Newton's first law applies to human behavior just much as it does to moving
objects: it is always easier to just keep doing what you're already doing.
Adjusting your behavior requires a deliberate application of willpower.

So I've decided to set some new years resolutions. The objective of this post is
to serve as a written record, to create a bit of accountability and increase the
chances of achieving these targets.

<br />

##### 1. Focus on health and fitness

Over the last few years, my fitness has gradually declined. While I'm not
suffering from any illnesses and my BMI is within a normal range, I'm no longer
able to run, lift and swim like I used to during high school and college. My
mind rationalizes this decline with all sorts of mental gymnastics but really
there is no excuse for my current lack of fitness. By far, the most important
goal I have set is to focus on my fitness. The first aspect of this goal is to
enforce a daily morning exercise routine for at least 45 minutes. The second
aspect is to sustain my nicotine and smoke-free lifestyle for this entire year.
At the time of writing, I've been working out daily for 14 days and been
nicotine free for 121 days.

It's also time I gradually adjust my diet and routine. I'm going to sleep by 12
AM and be up by 7:30. I'm resolving to cook something everyday and introduce eat
more vegetables and protein into my meals. Eliminating my weakness for junk food
will be very important - ice cream, potato chips and other such items will be a
once-a-week treat.

##### 2. Invest in relationships

As an introvert, it's hard for me to connect with new people and make friends.
While I seem gregarious enough at gatherings, I rarely go out of my way to
attend or plan them which makes meeting new people difficult. This year, I will
make a habit of meeting new people both online and offline. My strategy will be
to meet people online and offline through Lunchclub, going to meetups and in
general saying "yes" when it comes to hanging out. I will also make a concerted
effort not keep my cards as close to my chest as I usually do and be more open
with people about my feelings and personal life.

##### 3. Read and write more

When I was in highschool I would devour books at a fairly rapid clip, around 2 a
month. As I grew older and busier, physical books were replaced by online
articles, podcasts and audiobooks. Over the last 4 years especially, my mental
diet has feels full of empty calories and lacks protein. I feel like I live on
the surface and rarely dive deep into topics like I used to. This year, I'm
going to change all that by using my Kindle for at least an hour a day and
completing at least one book a month.

I also want to write 10x more than I usually do. Sowell said "the only way to
become a good writer is to keep being a bad writer and improving slowly". When
it comes to writing things down, I often fall into a vicious cycle of
procrastination, perfection and paralysis. This year, I plan to overcome it by
writing a daily log (for myself), a monthly book report and at least one post
every week until writing becomes second nature again.

##### 4. Build something cool and sell it

I've always enjoyed building things but I usually fail to complete them. My
intrinsic nature as an engineer is to keep tinkering with code for the sake of
it even when it stops making practical sense to do so. Over the last few years I
have trained myself to take a more holistic viewpoint and balance my desire for
perfect code with just getting things done. Done is better than perfect and this
year my goal will be to internalize this mantra as I complete and publish the
multitude of half-baked projects lying in private GitHub repos. The goal here
will be to revamp, polish and launch some of my legacy code within 3-7 days.

This is also the year where I will build a commercially viable product and go to
market. While I have cofounded or co-created other ventures before, none have
attained the product-market fit necessary for long term success. This year, I'm
going to give myself a solid 6 months to build and launch something others are
willing to pay for. The only measure of success will be revenue and number of
customers. This will be a forcing function that gets me out of my comfort zone
and helps me to take stock of how I spend my time.

##### 5. Start a garden, pursue my hobbies and volunteer

I find it difficult to keep a pet given all the traveling I do so I've decided
the next best thing is to start a small garden. I have some space on the roof of
my building so I'm going to work on a small garden as occupational therapy. I'll
post regular pictures of my plants once I've potted them when the weather
improves.

I'm going to restart my old hobbies; I will take photos or make origami at least
once a week and post the results on this blog. Also, it's really been too long
since I gave my time to helping others so I'm going to find an interesting
volunteer opportunity and give it at least 2-3 hours every other week.

#### Conclusion

That's it for now - health, relationships, reading, writing, work, hobbies,
making oxygen...it won't be easy but as Paul Graham once put it best - boring
progress makes for exceptional results.
